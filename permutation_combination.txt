itertools.accumulate(iterable[, function, *, initial=None])

Make an iterator that returns accumulated sums or accumulated results from other binary functions. 

The function defaults to addition. The function should accept two arguments, an accumulated total and a value from the iterable. 

If an initial value is provided, the accumulation will start with that value and the output will have one more element than the input iterable. 

The function argument can be set to min() for a running minimum, max() for a running maximum, or operator.mul() for a running product. Amortization tables can be built by accumulating interest and applying payments:
